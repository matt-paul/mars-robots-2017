I have used create-react-app to bootstrap this application, and then added airbnb eslint configuration.  This is a convenient way to get going quickly using a well regarded rule set, and a jest testing environment.  

I have added flow in, because whilst I have fairly limited experience with it, this seems like a great oppotunity for learning more about it.  No doubt I will not use it to it's full potential, but will do my best to make use of it.

I have decided to approach this in a way that is inspired by functional programming, and in particular patterns I have learnt from the use of redux over the last few months, such as immutability and partial application.  I hope this will work well!

I am tempted to make use of Ramda as another learning experience for this project, but think I will hold off and potentially incorporate it in refactoring later on, when I can understand whether adding it is worth it.
